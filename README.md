This project started from the react-admin tutorial [React Admin Tutorial](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Tutorial.html).
Which was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

  $ npm install -g create-react-app  
  $ create-react-app test-admin  
  $ cd test-admin/  
  $ yarn add react-admin  
  $ yarn start   
  
 This demo uses [JSONPlaceholder] (http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), a fake REST API designed for prototyping. Example:  
     curl http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/12
